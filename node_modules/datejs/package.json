To keep what is still the most full featured JavaScript Date library alive, maintained, and improved.\n\nCurrently we're on track towards a 1.0 release - having fixed almost all the exist bugs and added several new features, improved parsing, and many other changes.\n\n### How to Install/Use\n\nJust include the appropriate file from the build directory in your project. Files are named by their language and country code.\n\nFor example - date-en-US.js is suited for US English output. This is likely the most commonly used one.\n\n## File Structure\n\n* `build` Output from the Grunt powered build process\n    * `development` Non-minfied files with full comments. Suitable for development enviroments.\n    * `production` Fully minified (by Google's Closure Compiler) files suitable for production.  \n*  `src` All the source files used to build the final files.\n    * `core` The main DateJS source files.\n    * `i18n` Internationalization files. Language specifics (days of the week, regex formats,etc). Organized by IETF language tag (eg - en-US, etc).\n* `specs` Unit Tests written in Jasmine. Code coverage is calculated by BlanketJS. \n* `tests` Orginal unit tests for 2008 project. *Deprecated*.  \n",
